```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r load-data}
school_shootings <- read_csv("school-shootings-data.csv")
```

```{r summ-stats}

school_shootings %>%
  filter(!is.na(casualties)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = casualties)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of casualties") +
  xlab("Casualties") +
  ylab("Frequency")

```


```{r}
school_shootings %>%
  filter(!is.na(staffing)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = staffing)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of number of full-time teachers", subtitle = "At each shooting") +
  xlab("Amount of teachers") +
  ylab("Frequency")
```

```{r mean-staff-num}
school_shootings %>%
  filter(!is.na(staffing)) %>%
  summarise(median_staff_num = median(staffing))
```

We can also rank states by the number of school shootings that have occurred there:

```{r state-rank}
school_shootings %>%
  filter(!is.na(state)) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

One more thing that would be interesting to see is the distribution of the amount of students who qualify for free or reduced lunch.

```{r}
school_shootings %>%
  filter(!is.na(lunch)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = lunch)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

However, this might be misleading given that this is a raw number, whereas a proportion would be more useful.

Your project goes here! Before you submit, make sure your chunks are turned off with `echo = FALSE`. 

You can add sections as you see fit. Make sure you have a section called Introduction at the beginning and a section called Conclusion at the end. The rest is up to you!
